CentraleSupélec 2022, securing a special TED license to go beyond the 100-person cap and host 300+ attendees, with over 2,000 tuning in live. I raised ~$5k, led the team, and handled logistics on a tight budget to create one of the most meaningful projects of my life.

I scraped match history and odds, trained ML models to predict outcomes, and bet when my model disagreed with the market. Backtests showed a tiny edge, but my wallet said otherwise. 
&lt;link&gt;

I also built an automatic newsletter generator that, given a prompt or set of keywords, would scrape relevant content from trusted sources like ArXiv, Google News, and NewsAPI, summarize it, and rank it by relevance. It helped me keep upt with trending AI papers while I was in school, but one of my friend also used it to stay updated on what was happening back in their home country, Albania.

The challenge was to build a tool to help small businesses thrive in the digital age. We created Estimate, a mobile app that helps painters quickly generate accurate quotes for clients. We pitched it to a panel of Google PMs and took home first prize.

The maximal question time was twice as long as the original presentation time for each speaker, and only the person asking the question could decide if a question was answered.

Alexandre led the creation of Meditron, the top open-source medical LLM. Guillaume built agent evaluation pipelines at BCG X across multiple industries.

This helped us realize: no one is seriously productizing simulation infrastructure for agent training. That’s the gap we’re going after.</div></div><div data-q="Who are your competitors?

What do you understand about your business that they don't?</div><div class="mt-4 whitespace-pre-line text-[16px] text-black">Our competitors include internal simulation teams at AI labs (like DeepMind, OpenAI), academic platforms like BabyAGI/Gymnasium, and early startups focused on agent benchmarking or fine-tuning.

What they miss is that environments, not just models, are the core infrastructure bottleneck for agents. Labs build internal tools but never share them (they will have difficulty diversifying their in their environments); open-source platforms are too shallow for real use; and startups often focus on agents themselves, not the data and feedback loops that make agents work.

We’re building the infrastructure layer that unlocks realistic simulation at scale, with a modular system for domain-specific environments, something no one has productized in a general, reusable way.</div></div><div data-q="How do or will you make money? How much could you make?"><div class="text-[16px] font-bold">How do or will you make money? How much could you make?</div><div class="mt-4 whitespace-pre-line text-[16px] text-black">Phase 1: we work with AI labs and startups to build custom simulation environments for their agents, solving real problems up close and refining reusable infrastructure.

Phase 2: we evolve into a self-serve platform where users can create, simulate, and improve agents using modular components.

Long-term:
• Labs training agents via online RL will need behavioral data at scale, similar to how they once relied on Scale AI.
• Enterprises building internal agents will need tools to test and fine-tune them.

With strong execution, this can become a $10M+ ARR business serving both segments.</div></div><div data-q="Which category best applies to your company?"><div class="text-[16px] font-bold">Which category best applies to your company?</div><div class="mt-4 whitespace-pre-line text-[16px] text-black">Other</div></div><div data-q="If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please
